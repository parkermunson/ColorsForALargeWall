# Colors For a Large Wall

The assignment for this bootcamp project was to create an HTML form with various input types and a functional layout using CSS flex, and to demonstrate knowledge of advanced CSS rules and selectors. I though it would be cool to allow users to apply Ellsworth Kelly's 1951 paitning _Colors for a Large Wall_ to a large wall. 

Using CSS and HTML, I recreated Kelly's painting. When the user clicks the "Apply Wall" button, a wall appears. You know...for the colors.
