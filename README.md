# Colors For a Large Wall

The assignment for this bootcamp project was to create a functional layout using CSS flex, and to demonstrate knowledge of advanced HTML and CSS rules and selectors. I thought it would be cool to allow users to apply Ellsworth Kelly's 1951 painting _Colors for a Large Wall_ to a large wall. 

Using CSS and HTML, I recreated Kelly's painting. Using JavaScript, I made a button that allows users to apply the painting to the large wall.
